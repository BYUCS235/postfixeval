# postfixeval
In this learning activity, we will look at the code from chapter 5 of the book and see how we can use it to solve the postfixEvaluate() function in the lab.  If you didnt finish the [expressions learning activity](https://github.com/BYUCS235/expressions), download the code or create a new workspace from this git repo.
